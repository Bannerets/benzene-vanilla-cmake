A CMake managed Vanilla Benzene for playing and solving Hex.

No need to install Fuego, as Benzene only uses smartgame/ and gtpengine/,
they are now copied to src/ and will compile with other code together.

How to build?

cd to project directory, 
   
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ../ 
if there is no error, then just
   make 

This will make all requirred libraries and produce two executables src/wolve/wolve and src/mohex/mohex

Additional remarks for mac os:
in src/mohex/CMakeLists.txt
/usr/local/Cellar/berkeley-db/6.2.23/lib/
if your berkeley-db is at a different dir other than the above one, please uncomment and replace the correct dir in line 12

Prerequisite libraries: 
 berkeley-db
 libboost-all
